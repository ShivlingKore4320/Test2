                The First step in understanding how to position elements 
                is to understand the fundamental model od CSS-- the box model <br>
                <h3>The Box Model</h3><br>
                Every element you place on a page creates a box.<br> 
                You cannot always see the boundaries and the borders<br> 
                of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there. <br>
                A div element creates a box, as do h1,img, span, and <br>
                td elements. Each box has properties ou can set with CSS.<br> 
                I've illustrated some of these properties in Figure 1.<br><br>
                <h4>Figure 1 Border, padding, and margin</h4>
                The padding of a box is the distance between the content of<br> 
                the box and the box's border, and the margin is the distance<br>
                between a box and any adjacent element. In other words, <br>
                padding adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space<br> 
                outside the border. In the following CSS, I set both the padding <br>
                and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. This is why you can see <br>
                so much white space in Figure 1.The border surrounding every element <br>
                is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can change the color of <br>
                an element's border, as well as the thickness and line style the browser <br>
                uses when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 is the result <br>
                of a style rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin, red line <br>
                around the box that each div element creates.
